# SEO_and_Accessibility

This is a project build around the idea of SEO improvments.</br>
You'll find the original site stored in the Original folder and the site after the modification I made in the Modified folder.</br>
The aim was to make 10 changes to the site (in its architecture, accessibility, or even concerning the use of image) to improve its speed, reduce its size and overall get a better accessibility and referencing. </br>
